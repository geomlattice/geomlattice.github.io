  <h2>Joseph Liouville</h2>
  <p>Joseph Liouville stands beside Cauchy with many similar influences within the annals of French Mathematics. His workwas not only prolific, but he was editor of a journal which had many of the most well remembered names of his day published in. His knowledge of the terrian of not only French but also German Mathematics in the 1840s is remarkable. His early work anticpates much of Spectral Theory.</p>
  <p>Liouville took to political action during those turbulent years of 1848. Dismayed by the eventual outcome of these events, having lost his seat in Government to the general turmoil, he went into seclusion for some time though he remained teaching when inflammatory conditions lessened.</p>
  <p>In the late 1850s, Liouville begins working on Number Theory, though many of his results remained in private notebooks as opposed to the prolific publishing of the pre 1848 period. Students and avid readers have offered proofs for some of his published work of these years, though seemingly with techniques and underlying philosophies which may not characterize the proofs that remained in those notebooks[1].</p>
